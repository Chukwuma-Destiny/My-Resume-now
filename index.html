   <h2> PERSONAL STATEMENT</h2>

    into value creation. As such, I have volunteered in promoting themes such as STEM education, Education for Sustainable Deveolopment, Openscience, Policy advocacy on
industrialisation of African Countries, particularly Nigeria where I come from. I am a researcher,writer and a teacher. Overall, I believe in working together to
